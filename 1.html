  <h2>Jack Lowden은 누구인가?</h2>
  <u>"The local music scene</u> is the sole preserve of troglodytes
  whose regard for subtlety and variation is comparable
  to a pig's passion for <strong> the slaughter house"</strong>.
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">It was a bit crazy. We had an amazing casting director called Theo Park
  and the first name that she mentioned was Jack Lowden.
  And actually, initially, I’d scripted it so that the two guys in the film
  were in their mid-30s, and she immediately said she thought the film
  would be more palatable and it would work better if they were younger.</p>

  Jack at that time was around 25. So I pondered that for a couple of weeks
  and decided she was right; it gave a bigger age differentiation between them
  and the locals, which felt, instinctually, like a good thing.</p>
